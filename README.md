'Enhanced Snake Game' üêç - Because regular Snake was just too... *normal*. (And because boredom is a powerful motivator for experimental coding projects.)

Let's be honest, the original Snake game is a masterpiece, but even masterpieces can use a little... *spice*.  So, fueled by pure, unadulterated boredom and a desire to tinker, I (perhaps foolishly) decided to "enhance" it.  Consider this my attempt to stave off existential dread through pixelated reptiles. The result?  Well, see for yourself!  Don't expect groundbreaking game design ‚Äì this is purely a "for fun" experiment, but hey, maybe it'll be *your* kind of fun! And who knows, if I find myself bored again, maybe there will be *even more* enhancements down the line... (no promises!).

### Here's what you're signing up for in this monument to procrastination:

*   **Snake Gameplay - Remastered (Slightly):**  It's Snake, but with *features*!  (I promise they're mostly enhancements. Mostly.).
*   **Wrap-Around Walls - For Maximum Chaos:**  Because getting cornered is for amateurs. Embrace the void!
*   **Bonus Food - Because Regular Food Isn't Enough:**  Spoil your snake with the finer things in pixelated life. We're talking *bonus* pixels here.
*   **Power-Ups - Temporary God-Mode for Snakes:**  Feel the fleeting power of speed and invincibility! (Use them wisely. Or don't. It's all experimental anyway).
*   **Soundtrack to Slither By:**  Retro sounds that will transport you back to the arcade (or your basement, no judgment). Guaranteed to be at least 8-bit.
*   **High Score Hall of Fame:**  Bragging rights are on the line.  Don't let your score be a *hiss*-tory. Prove that your boredom-fueled gaming sessions were *not* in vain!

Download if you dare! Side effects may include:  increased reflexes, a strange urge to eat apples, the inability to look at straight lines the same way again, and the unsettling realization that someone made this game because they were bored. üòâ
